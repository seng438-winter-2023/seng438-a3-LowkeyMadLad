**1 Introduction**

In this lab, we will be learning about white-box test methods such as data flow coverage and control flow coverage. We will do this by manually calculating data flow coverage as well as using testing tools to improve our line, branch, and method coverage for our tests from assignment 2.

**For each test case show which pairs are covered **

1-2,1-3,1-4,1-8, and 3-4 is covered by the following test in our previous assignment, test_3x3_ColumnTotal(). It will only go through the first for loop in this test and sum up the values. It will only go through the first column. 

1-2,1-3,1-4,1-8, and 3-4 is covered by the following test in our previous assignment, testMixedColumnTotal(). It will go through the first loop in this test and sum the mixture of positive and negative values. It will go through the second column. 

1-2,1-3,1-4,1-8, and 3-4 is covered by the following test in our previous assignment, testNegativeColumnTotal(). It will only go through the first for loop in this test and sum up the negative values in the column. Will go through the third column. 

1-2,1-3,1-4,1-8, and 3-4 is covered by the following test in our previous assignment, testTooBigColumnTotal(). It will go through the first loop in this test and will not sum up any of the values as the column will be too big and it will do an exception catch. 

1-2,1-3,1-4,1-8, and 3-4 is covered by the following test in our previous assignment,

testTooSmallColumnTotal(). It will go through the first loop in this test and will not sum up any of the values as the column will be too small and it will do an exception catch. 

1-2,1-3,1-4,1-8, and 3-4 is covered by the following test in our previous assignment, testZeroColumnTotal(). It will go through the first loop in this test and it will sum up the values in the second column of all zeros. 

There are no paths covered by the following test in our previous assignment, testNullColumnTotal(). It will get to the method but it will not go through the method at all and will do an exception catch since the values would be invalid. 

**Calculate DU-Pair Coverage**

test_3x3_ColumnTotal(), testMixedColumnTotal(),testNegativeColumnTotal(), testTooBigColumnTotal() , testTooBigColumnTotal() ,testTooSmallColumnTotal(), testZeroColumnTotal(), all use 4 pairs, and there are a total of 13 pairs. The total coverage for this each of theses tests would be

**For each test case which pairs are covered **

1-2 is covered by the following test from our previous assignment, test_contains_DoesNotContainLowerTest(). As it will look for a value that is lower than the lower boundary. 

1-4 is covered by the following test from our previous assignment, test_contains_DoesNotContainUpperTest(). As it will look for a value that is higher than the upper boundary. 

1-5 is tested through test_contains_TestUpper(), test_contains_TestLower(), test_contains_TestMiddle(). As all of these are looking for values that are in the upper and lower boundaries. 

**Calculate DU-Pair Coverage**

test_contains_DoesNotContainLowerTest(), test_contains_DoesNotContainUpperTest(), test_contains_TestUpper(), test_contains_TestLower(), test_contains_TestMiddle() all  use only 1 pair. The total coverage for each of these tests would be

**3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test**

First of all, since the tool we are using, ECLEmma does not include statement coverage or condition coverage, we chose to use different coverage criteria. To replace statement coverage, we used line coverage because it is essentially the same, as we are just testing which lines are being run. Also, instead of using condition coverage, we did method coverage as recommended by the assignment guidelines. Our goal was to get 90% line/statement coverage, 80% branch coverage, and 90% method coverage.

The strategy that we will follow for writing new unit tests will be aiming to cover as much of the line/statement coverage for each of the previous tests and the new tests. As mentioned in the lab handout the main testing method would be coverage-based testing. As a result, if we were to get as much of the line/statement coverage it can increase both the branch coverage and method coverage. We also would try to think of as many possible test cases in order to get the coverage requirements, such as testing for null values for some methods, non objects and exceptions that we didn’t do in the previous assignment. In order to get the full coverage just when writing a new test, running it right away and seeing the coverage can be helpful as it can save a lot of time as it will allow the person writing the test to confirm that their test case works. 


# 
**4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage**


## test_Range_LowerBiggerThanUpper()

For this test, we tested making a Range object where the lower value is bigger than upper, which is illegal, and throws an exception. Thus, it increased the branch coverage by checking the branch where lower > upper.


## test_constrain_objNotContainsUpperValue()

For this test, we tested the constrain function. We tested by constraining for a value that is larger than the range of the Range object. This increased the branch coverage by checking the branch where the value is not in range of the object and is also above the upper value. This satisfies !contains(value) and value > this.upper.


## test_combine_NullRange1()

For this test, we tested the combine function. We tested by combining a null Range object with a null range value. This increases the branch coverage by checking the branch where the first object is a null value, thus satisfying the range1 == null condition.


## test_equals_NonRangeObject()

For this test, we tested the equals function. We tested by equating a Range object with a non-Range object. This increases the branch coverage by checking the branch where the Range object does not satisfy !(obj instanceof Range).


## test_scale_BelowZeroFactor()

For this test, we tested the scale method. We tested by inputting a scale factor below zero, which is illegal.This increased the branch coverage by testing the branch where the scale factor is below 0.

**6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report**

For this assignment we used ECLEmma


## Pros

ECLEmma was incredibly easy to set up with Eclipse, which was the IDE we were using. All we had to do was add it on the Eclipse marketplace, which made setup easy to get started. In addition, it was user friendly as all the coverage tests allowed us to view  which branches and lines were covered graphically. This made it a lot easier to write tests to increase coverage as we could simply look at which lines were coloured red. It was also easy to see the coverage metrics and it calculated all of the coverages for us.


## Cons

Unfortunately, ECLEmma did not provide coverage for condition coverage or statement coverage, which made it impossible to follow the assignment exactly. This limiting of choices was inconvenient, which led us to have to choose other coverage criterias that were as similar as possible. Also, the metrics were not super intuitive to view. There was no selection to view only the coverage of one class, and we had to scroll through all of the classes in the project every time to view the coverage, which was irritating.


# 
**7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.**

Advantages of requirements-based testing are that there is a clear plan for the test writer to follow. As a result there won’t be as much confusion when writing tests as it allows for the developer to have a good understanding of what needs to be done. As well as it allows for the developer to plan out their test cases more easily.  A disadvantage of the requirements-based testing is that it might not fully cover all the cases as seen in this lab when we ran the old tests and looked at the coverage of the tests.  \
 \
While for coverage-based testing there might be a lack of instructions and there might be some confusion on what needs to be done. But there are advantages to the coverage-based testing is that you will fully be able to get full coverage/test all of the code needed. While some disadvantages can be that there is a need for a lot of tools that need to be installed. As well as the need to write many tests in order to get the full coverage of the code that needs to be tested. 


# 
**8 A discussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed**

Each group member would contribute equally and we came together as a group in the beginning to assign each group member a task for this assignment. The way we split the work for this assignment would be Alex would do the 3.2 section, Gabe and Ryan would do the section for DataUtilities and split that work among themselves and Luke would do the tests for Range. In the end we would all come together as a group and look over each other's tests and give suggestions if needed.  If group members had questions about specific sections someone in the group could help that other group member out. 


# 
**9 Any difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned from performing the lab**

Some difficulties that we encountered during the lab was getting the testing environment set up as a group. It took a long time as we were a little confused due to the instructions, but we were then able to figure it out after some time. In addition to this when writing new tests it took a little bit of time to get started on tests and what we can do in order to get the coverage requirements. But when drafting up the plan that we were going to follow for this assignment it made it more clear what we need to do in order to get the full coverage. Another difficulty that was encountered was that some group members might’ve had an easier time writing tests depending on the test that they wrote it would have more coverage. In addition to this since the 2 files were different there would also be a difference in the amount of tests that each person wrote.  \


To overcome these difficulties we would just invest more time in order to figure it out, in addition to this we would also ask other group members if they understood the problem at hand.  As a result most of the problems would be solved by just asking another group member. When drafting up the plan that we were going to follow it was a challenge to have a clear direction but after we had a small discussion about what would be the most optimal way we all would then agree on it and would follow that.  \
 \
A lesson that we learned from the lab was that we can aim to divide the work up more evenly or just let other group members know if another group member needs help. Initially when we met up we just assigned tasks without actually knowing the difference in the amount of work that needed to be done. Next time for those that finish their tasks can also help others if needed. Another lesson we learned was when working on this lab we needed to allocate more time earlier to get work done, as we were rushing to get all of it complete due to lack of planning. For next time we will be more time efficient and allocate more time throughout the week to get the next lab complete. 


# 
**10 Comments/feedback on the lab itself**

Some comments/feedback for this lab there was a lot of reading that needed to be done in order to get a full understanding of the lab. We also thought that some of the instructions were a little unclear which led to some confusion within our group. It would also be a little helpful if it was mentioned on the lab instructions if there was a rough amount on how much work would be needed to be done on the 2 separate files as when doing the work we realized that one of the files required significantly more work in order to finish/write tests for. There would also sometimes be some conflicting information on the document or some confusing parts that were in the lab document.
